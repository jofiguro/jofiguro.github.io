## STEPS TO CREATE GITHUB PAGE :
> 1. **Create a local repository** and configure Git by setting username and email.
> 2. Create ***index.html*** and push it to the Github remote repository.
> 3. Change Github remote repository's visibility to **public**.
> 4. **Configure Github Pages** via settings by selecting the branch that will host the static website. 
> 5. Once done, visit your website using **Github Organization Pages** or by your generated personal links.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS :
> * Implementing CSS requires significant time and effort.
> * From my perspective, numerous CSS features are yet to be explored and mastered.
> * Working with flexbox and grouping HTML elements can sometimes be challenging.
